## Project Description

Performance modelling is a way to predict the resources a system will require when being built or undergoing changes. There are two major ways which performance of a system can be modelled: capacity modelling, and simulation modelling. 

### Capacity Modelling
Capacity modelling allows for gathering information related to scaling a system, and the capacity required at each level of scaling. This is usually measured in users (ie: 10 users, 100 users, 1000 users). Additionally, capacity modelling can be used to test how different configurations (or an increase in workload) will run compared to the current configuration for the same capacity the system is currently at. 

### Simulation Modelling
Simulation modelling involves running a simulated model of the system with variations of workload, users, requests, and delays. A simulation model can solve important aspects of the system, such as throughput, utilization and response time

What the project is to achieve, a half to one page. Please describe the educational component of the project.

## Background Requirements

 *  Good programming skills in Java
 *  Good analytical and communication skills
 *  Knowledge in AI and statistics
 *  Interested in large scale software analysis 

## Resources

 *[OPERA]()

### Software
 * Java
 * ghtorrent

## Readings

 * [Performance Modelling is Doable and Useful](http://www1.practicalperformanceanalyst.com/2013/08/09/performance-modeling-is-doable-and-useful-its-not-as-scary-or-difficult-as-you-might-believe/)

## Deliverables

 * List of artifacts to be completed by the final due date; includes programs, documentation, reports, user guides, etc. One of them is your final project poster presentation on a date around the end of term, usually during the exam period or at the start of the next term.

## Evaluation

Indication as to how the project will be evaluated. For example, the project can be marked on the basis of the progress towards stated goals, and the clarity and completeness of programs, documentation and reports. It is strongly recommended and encouraged that evaluation has a number of components and not just a grade at the end. Grades can be associated with different deliverables or their parts. Components could include: documentation, programming style, quality of the interface design, project proposal presentation, project status presentations, and overall evaluation.

At least 20% of the evaluation should be available before the drop date.

The following is an example. Note that all projects must have a requirement for a poster preparation and presentation. The grading of this requirement is worth 30% of the final grade and is assigned by the CSE4080 seminar committee. By signing this contract both student and supervisor agree to participate in the seminar day which will be typically scheduled during the exam week or in the first week of class following the term that student is enrolled in CSE4080. Students and supervisors should check the course web page for the current term to find the date scheduled for the seminars.
